- Replit-specific plugins for development tooling
- File system restrictions for security

### Production Build
- Client bundle optimized with Vite and served from dist/public
- Server bundle created with esbuild for Node.js execution
- Static file serving integrated with Express
- Environment-based configuration for database connections

### Database Management
- Drizzle migrations stored in /migrations directory
- Schema definitions in shared directory for type consistency
- Environment variable configuration for database URL
- Push-based deployment strategy with drizzle-kit

### Hosting Considerations
- Designed for Replit deployment with banner integration
